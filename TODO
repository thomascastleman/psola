To Do

- [ ] Smoothing between successive buffers to eliminate artifacts?
- [ ] Allowing synthesis peaks to extend beyond the buffer range?
- [ ] Test infrastructure
  - [ ] Dump input buffer, output buffer, and PSOLA analysis on failure
  - [ ] Visualization tool: Show both waveforms, peaks. Show ideal output?
  - [ ] Actual vocal samples
    - [ ] Tool for recording vocal samples and outputting as arrays of samples dumped into generated/
    - [ ] Run pitch detection on these samples and do the same kind of shifting tests
